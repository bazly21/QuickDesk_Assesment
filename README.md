# QuickDesk_Assesment

Hi, this is my internship assessment that I got from QuickDesk company. Below are the question and the answer

Question 
a. Write 2 classes to implement the following IQueuable interface 
Interface IQueuable { 
//adds value to queue and returns new queue 
enqueue(value: string): string[]; 
//removes item from queue, and returns the item removed dequeue(): string; 
//returns a list of all the items in the queue 
getQueue(): string[]; 
//returns the number of items in the queue 
size():number; 
} 
Build your queues ontop of arrays; call your classes FIFOQUEUE and 
LIFOQUEUE (first-in first-out & last-in first-out) queues, or QUEUE and STACK, whichever names you prefer.
